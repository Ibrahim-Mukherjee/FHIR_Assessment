FHIR Data to Pandas Dataframe
This Python script allows you to convert FHIR standard data in JSON format into a Pandas dataframe for further analysis. The script can handle multiple JSON files in a directory and concatenates them into a single dataframe.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3
Pandas library
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
Install the required Python libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Store your FHIR standard data JSON files in the data directory in the root of the repository.
Open the fhir_to_dataframe.py file in your preferred Python environment (e.g. Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab)
Run the script
The resulting Pandas dataframe will be stored in the combined_df variable.
Output
The resulting Pandas dataframe contains the following columns:

resourceType: the FHIR resource type (e.g. "Patient", "Observation")
type: the type of data (e.g. "searchset", "resource")
entry: the actual data in JSON format
patient_id: the patient ID extracted from the entry column
